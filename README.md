# Crowdfunding-ETL
## In this Challenge, I used Python, Pandas, and Jupyter notebooks to do the extract and transform the data. I extracted and transformed the backers’ contact information from a CSV file to create a DataFrame that was exported as a CSV file. I then loaded the transformed data. I used the dataset to create an ERD and a table schema for creating a new table in the crowdfunding_db database. I uploaded the CSV file that contains the backers’ information into this table. Finally, I perform a data analysis on the crowdfunding_db database by using SQL queries.
